# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- Who are the Top 10 artists and their track names based on popularity? --

SELECT artist_name,
       track_name,
       popularity
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
 ORDER BY popularity DESC
 LIMIT 10;


-- What is the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist?

SELECT artist_name,
avg(popularity),
avg(danceability),
avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) desc;

-- What Artists appear on the list mulitple times? How many times do they appear?

SELECT COUNT(artist_name) appearances,
artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING appearances > 1
ORDER BY appearances desc;

-- Of the artists that appear mulitple times, which one had the highest average popularity?

SELECT artist_name,
ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) avg_pop
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name
IN (SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(artist_name) > 1)
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_pop desc;



-- What artist released the longest song? --

SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms
IN (SELECT max(duration_ms) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);

-- What are the Track IDs for all songs by Olivia Rodrigo? --

SELECT artist_name,
track_id,
track_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
GROUP BY track_id;
